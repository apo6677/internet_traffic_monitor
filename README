The tool was implemented following the given specifications.

In order to filter traffic you have to press -f just like the specifications
although the port from traffic will be monitored is specified with a user's scanf from terminal. 
Note that if the number you input does not correspond with an actual port the program won't work. 
Moreover the user has to input the number of packets that are going to be
"sniffed" whether it is live capture or offline capture from a pcap file. This happens with the use of a scanf again.
Live captures are going to be stored in a file named log. Finaly on live capture the user has to input the correct name of the device hw wants "sniffed".

Retranssmisions indicator does not seem to work.
